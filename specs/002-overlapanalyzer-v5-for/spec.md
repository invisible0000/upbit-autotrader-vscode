# Feature Specification: OverlapAnalyzer v5.0

**Feature Branch**: `002-overlapanalyzer-v5-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "OverlapAnalyzer v5 for candle data overlap detection with five state classification"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a market data management system, I need to analyze whether requested candle data already exists in local storage to optimize API calls and reduce redundant data requests.

When analyzing candle data requests, the system should:
1. Examine the local database for existing data in the requested time range
2. Classify the overlap pattern into one of five distinct states
3. Provide specific recommendations on what data to fetch from API versus what to retrieve from local storage

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no local data exists for the requested time range, **When** overlap analysis is performed, **Then** system classifies as "NO_OVERLAP" and recommends full API request
2. **Given** complete local data exists for the exact requested range, **When** overlap analysis is performed, **Then** system classifies as "COMPLETE_OVERLAP" and recommends local data retrieval only
3. **Given** partial local data exists starting from request beginning, **When** overlap analysis is performed, **Then** system classifies as "PARTIAL_START" and recommends hybrid approach
4. **Given** partial local data exists in middle with gaps, **When** overlap analysis is performed, **Then** system classifies as "PARTIAL_MIDDLE_FRAGMENT" and recommends full API request
5. **Given** partial local data exists continuously at the end, **When** overlap analysis is performed, **Then** system classifies as "PARTIAL_MIDDLE_CONTINUOUS" and recommends API for missing start portion only

### Edge Cases
- What happens when requested time range spans multiple data gaps?
- How does system handle microsecond-level timestamp precision differences?
- What occurs when database connection fails during analysis?
- How does system respond to invalid time range inputs (start > end)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept overlap analysis requests with symbol, timeframe, target start time, target end time, and expected count
- **FR-002**: System MUST classify overlap patterns into exactly five states: NO_OVERLAP, COMPLETE_OVERLAP, PARTIAL_START, PARTIAL_MIDDLE_FRAGMENT, PARTIAL_MIDDLE_CONTINUOUS
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide specific API request ranges when partial data fetching is needed
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide specific local database query ranges when existing data should be used
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate time range consistency (start < end) and reject invalid requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle timeframe-specific calculations (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d) accurately
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect and report gaps in continuous data sequences
- **FR-008**: System MUST optimize performance by using indexed database queries with early termination
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain accuracy within single timeframe unit precision (no sub-minute errors for 1m data)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide deterministic results for identical input parameters

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OverlapRequest**: Contains symbol, timeframe, target start time, target end time, expected candle count
- **OverlapResult**: Contains classification status, recommended API ranges, recommended database ranges, metadata about gaps or partial coverage
- **OverlapStatus**: Enumeration of the five classification states with specific meanings
- **TimeRange**: Represents start and end timestamps with timeframe-aware calculations
- **GapInfo**: Details about detected discontinuities in local data coverage
